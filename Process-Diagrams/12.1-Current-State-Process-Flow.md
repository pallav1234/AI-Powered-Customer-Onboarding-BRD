# 12.1 Current State Process Flow

The current state of the customer onboarding process is **manual, fragmented, and resource-intensive**. Multiple touchpoints exist across different departments with little automation.

---

## Key Steps in Current State
1. **Customer Application Submission** – Customers manually fill out forms and submit documents.
2. **Document Verification** – Operations team verifies identity proofs, address proofs, and financial history.
3. **Compliance Check** – Compliance team performs manual KYC and AML checks.
4. **Internal Approvals** – Multiple layers of approval are required before account activation.
5. **Customer Communication** – Updates are shared via email/phone, often delayed.
6. **Onboarding Completion** – Customer account is created after all manual steps are done.

## Challenges in the Current State
- High manual effort and **operational cost**
- **Delays** due to multi-level approvals
- **Inconsistent customer experience**
- **Compliance risks** from manual KYC/AML checks
- Lack of **real-time tracking**

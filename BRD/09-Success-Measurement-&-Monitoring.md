# 9. Success Measurement & Monitoring


This section defines the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and monitoring mechanisms to measure the success of the AI-powered customer onboarding initiative.

## Key Success Metrics

| ID   | Metric                           | Target Value / KPI | Description |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| SM-1 | Onboarding Completion Rate       | ≥ 95%             | Percentage of customers who successfully complete onboarding without drop-offs. |
| SM-2 | Average Onboarding Time          | ≤ 5 minutes       | Time taken from login to successful account activation. |
| SM-3 | KYC Verification Accuracy        | ≥ 98%             | Accuracy of AI-driven KYC validation (OCR, liveness, document matching). |
| SM-4 | Manual Review Rate               | ≤ 10%             | Percentage of onboarding cases that require human intervention. |
| SM-5 | Regulatory Compliance Incidents  | 0                 | Number of non-compliance incidents flagged by auditors/regulators. |
| SM-6 | Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)     | ≥ 4.5/5           | Customer feedback on ease of onboarding process. |

## Monitoring Approach
- **Dashboards**: Real-time tracking of KPIs via BI dashboards.  
- **Alerts & Thresholds**: Automated alerts for SLA breaches (e.g., onboarding > 5 minutes).  
- **Audits**: Quarterly compliance and process audits.  
- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Collect customer & branch feedback for improvement.  


## **9.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- **Customer Onboarding Completion Rate (%)** – Measure % of users who successfully complete onboarding.  
- **Average Onboarding Time (minutes)** – Track reduction from baseline (3–5 days → <10 minutes).  
- **Dropout Reduction (%)** – Compare dropouts pre- and post-implementation.  
- **KYC Accuracy & Fraud Detection Rate** – Monitor AI-driven verification effectiveness.  
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS)** – Assess customer experience post-onboarding.  

## **9.2 Monitoring Mechanisms**
- **Real-time Dashboards** – Provide operational visibility.  
- **Weekly Performance Reports** – Track trends and variances.  
- **AI-powered Anomaly Alerts** – Detect unusual activities or sudden drops.  

## **9.3 Feedback Loops**
- **Customer Feedback Surveys** – Capture satisfaction immediately post-onboarding.  
- **Relationship Manager Updates** – Continuous inputs from customer-facing staff.  
- **Employee Usability Feedback** – Collect insights from staff using the system.

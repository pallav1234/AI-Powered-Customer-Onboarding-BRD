## 1.1 Introduction
Indian retail banking onboarding suffers from high dropouts and manual KYC delays (3–5 days). With RBI/UIDAI’s push for digital KYC and V-CIP, an AI-powered onboarding approach can reduce friction, improve compliance, and scale efficiently.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
- Customers abandon onboarding due to lengthy steps and slow verification.  
- Inconsistent manual KYC creates compliance exposure.  
- Operations teams spend significant time on data entry & document checks.

## 1.3 Proposed Solution (AI-Powered Onboarding)
- AI document verification (OCR + forgery detection) for Aadhaar/PAN/POA.  
- Face match & liveness for V-CIP.  
- Predictive dropout analysis to proactively assist at-risk users.  
- Automated compliance checks aligned to RBI/UIDAI norms.

## 1.4 Objectives
- Reduce onboarding TAT to ≤ 10 minutes.  
- Increase completion rate by ≥ 25%.  
- Reduce manual review workload by ≥ 60%.  
- Maintain adherence to RBI/UIDAI KYC guidelines.

## 1.5 Expected Benefits
- Better CX (faster, clearer, mobile-first).  
- Lower operating cost per onboarding.  
- Reduced audit findings & penalties.  
- Higher conversion and revenue growth.

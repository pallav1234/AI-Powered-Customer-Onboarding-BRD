6. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) define the quality attributes, performance standards, and compliance expectations for the AI-powered customer onboarding solution. These requirements ensure the system is not only functionally correct but also secure, reliable, scalable, and user-friendly.

6.1 Performance

The system shall process customer onboarding requests with an average turnaround time (TAT) ≤ 10 minutes from document submission to decision.

OCR and AI verification services must achieve a minimum throughput of 1000 concurrent transactions per second (TPS) under peak load.

The system must support 95%+ automation rate in KYC checks, with ≤15% cases requiring manual review fallback.

6.2 Security & Compliance

All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) shall be encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).

Aadhaar and PAN details shall be masked in storage, with only authorized compliance officers able to view full details.

The solution shall comply with RBI Master Directions on KYC (2023), UIDAI Aadhaar Offline Verification guidelines, and IT Act (2000) Amendments on data privacy.

All user actions (customer + internal staff) must be logged in a tamper-proof audit trail for 10 years as per RBI requirements.

6.3 Scalability

The system shall scale to support 5 million active customers within the first year.

Infrastructure must auto-scale to handle 3x peak onboarding demand (e.g., festival seasons, salary days).

AI models must be re-trainable every 6 months using incremental datasets, without system downtime.

6.4 Availability & Reliability

The onboarding platform shall maintain 99.9% uptime SLA (maximum downtime ≤ 8.7 hours annually).

Disaster recovery (DR) system must ensure RTO ≤ 1 hour and RPO ≤ 15 minutes.

The platform must provide graceful degradation — if AI services fail, fallback to manual onboarding workflow is auto-triggered.

6.5 Usability

Mobile onboarding forms shall load within 2 seconds on a 4G connection.

The interface must support multilingual onboarding (English, Hindi, +2 regional languages in phase 1).

Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA to support visually impaired and differently-abled users.

6.6 Integration

The system must integrate with external APIs including:

UIDAI Aadhaar Offline e-KYC (XML/QR code verification)

NSDL PAN Verification API

Banking Core Systems (CBS) for customer ID creation

All APIs must support RESTful JSON with response times ≤ 200ms.

The implementation of the AI-powered customer onboarding solution will be carried out in a phased manner to minimize operational risk, ensure regulatory compliance, and enable measurable business value delivery at each stage.

7.1 Phase 1 – Foundation (0–3 Months)

Activities:

Define detailed requirements & finalize scope with stakeholders.

Set up cloud infrastructure and secure sandbox environment.

Integrate UIDAI Aadhaar Offline e-KYC and NSDL PAN APIs.

Build baseline OCR + face recognition model (MVP).

Deliverables:

MVP version of onboarding platform.

Initial compliance certification (RBI/UIDAI).

Milestone: First internal pilot with 100 test users.

7.2 Phase 2 – Pilot Rollout (4–6 Months)

Activities:

Deploy AI-powered KYC verification engine in limited production.

Conduct pilot onboarding for retail customers (10,000–50,000 users).

Collect performance metrics (dropout %, processing time).

Establish manual fallback + escalation workflows.

Deliverables:

Pilot success report with KPIs vs targets.

User feedback insights & UX refinements.

Milestone: Approval for full-scale rollout.

7.3 Phase 3 – Full Rollout (7–12 Months)

Activities:

Expand onboarding to mass retail + premium customer segments.

Launch multilingual onboarding support (English, Hindi + 2 regional).

Integrate predictive dropout model to flag at-risk users.

Deploy compliance dashboard for regulatory reporting.

Deliverables:

Nationwide availability of AI-powered onboarding.

Trained compliance officers + operations team.

Milestone: 1M+ customers onboarded with <10 min TAT.

7.4 Phase 4 – Optimization & Scale (12+ Months)

Activities:

Retrain AI models with real-world datasets every 6 months.

Implement advanced fraud detection (transaction + behavioral).

Expand to UPI-based onboarding + credit card applications.

Benchmark against competitors (HDFC, ICICI, SBI fintech arms).

Deliverables:

Continuous improvement plan.

Future roadmap for cross-product onboarding.

Milestone: Achieve 95%+ automation and 99.9% uptime SLA.

7.5 Dependencies

Regulatory approvals from RBI & UIDAI.

API access from UIDAI/NSDL/banking core systems.

Cloud infrastructure readiness.

7.6 Risks & Mitigation

Risk: Delays in API integration.

Mitigation: Parallel vendor engagement; sandbox first.

Risk: Model accuracy below threshold.

Mitigation: Hybrid AI + manual fallback, iterative training.

Risk: Resistance from internal compliance teams.

Mitigation: Early training & involvement in pilot.

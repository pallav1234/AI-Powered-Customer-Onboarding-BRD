# 2. Current State Analysis

The current customer onboarding process in retail banking is manual, fragmented, and time-consuming.

Customers are required to visit physical branches to submit KYC (Know Your Customer) documents.

Verification takes 3–5 business days due to dependency on manual review.

Drop-offs are as high as 40% in digital channels due to poor UX and lack of real-time support.

Fraud detection is limited, relying mostly on manual document checks, which increases risk.

Regulatory compliance is met, but with high cost and inefficiency.

This results in customer frustration, operational delays, and missed revenue opportunities.

## 2.1 As-Is Process (Summary)
1) Customer fills basic forms → 2) Uploads documents → 3) Ops manually extract & validate → 4) Compliance review → 5) Decision in 48–72 hours.

## 2.2 Pain Points (Quantified)
- 20–30% dropouts due to long steps & lack of guidance.  
- 3–5 days average manual KYC cycle time.

# 12. Risk Assessment

This section highlights the **potential risks** associated with implementing the AI-powered customer onboarding solution, along with strategies to **mitigate** them.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

1. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**
   - *Risk*: AI-based KYC and onboarding may not meet RBI or data privacy regulations.  
   - *Mitigation*: Regular compliance audits, legal reviews, and alignment with RBI/KYC norms.  

2. **Data Security Breach**
   - *Risk*: Sensitive customer data (Aadhaar, PAN, biometrics) could be exposed.  
   - *Mitigation*: End-to-end encryption, secure cloud storage, strict access control, and regular penetration testing.  

3. **AI Model Bias**
   - *Risk*: AI-driven verification may discriminate due to poor training datasets.  
   - *Mitigation*: Use diverse datasets, continuous retraining, and AI ethics reviews.  

4. **Technology Adoption Challenges**
   - *Risk*: Bank staff and customers may resist or face difficulty in adapting to AI-driven onboarding.  
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive training programs, customer education, and phased rollout.  

5. **Operational Downtime**
   - *Risk*: System outages could delay onboarding.  
   - *Mitigation*: High-availability architecture, backup systems, and disaster recovery planning.  

6. **Integration Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Legacy banking systems may not integrate seamlessly with AI modules.  
   - *Mitigation*: Use APIs, middleware solutions, and conduct pilot integrations.

## Risk Monitoring
- Establish a **Risk Management Committee**.  
- Review risks at each project milestone.  
- Maintain a **Risk Register** for tracking and mitigation.

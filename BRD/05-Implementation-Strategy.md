# 5. Implementation Strategy

This section describes the **approach to implement** the AI-powered onboarding system in a phased, controlled manner.

---

## 5.1 Phased Rollout
1. **Phase 1: Pilot**
   - Limited rollout to a small customer segment (e.g., 5,000 users).
   - Focus on Aadhaar/PAN OCR, selfie verification, and digital KYC.
   - Gather feedback on dropout points and AI accuracy.

2. **Phase 2: Scale-Up**
   - Extend to wider customer base across regions.
   - Integrate advanced fraud detection (duplicate detection, anomaly scoring).
   - Introduce chatbot-based nudges to reduce dropouts.

3. **Phase 3: Full Deployment**
   - Nationwide rollout for all new customer onboarding.
   - Enable API integrations with regulators (UIDAI, CKYC, RBI watchlists).
   - Launch analytics dashboard for compliance and business insights.

---

## 5.2 Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: React Native (Mobile), Angular (Web)  
- **Back-end**: Java / Spring Boot  
- **AI Models**: Python (OCR, Face Matching, Liveness Detection)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + MongoDB for unstructured data  
- **Cloud**: AWS (preferred), with auto-scaling enabled  
- **Integration**: REST APIs, Kafka for event-driven communication  

---

## 5.3 Risk Mitigation
- **Regulatory Risk** → Engage compliance team early, align with RBI & SEBI norms.  
- **Technology Risk** → Run pilots with fallback manual KYC.  
- **Customer Risk** → Provide assisted channels for low-digital literacy users.  
- **Security Risk** → End-to-end encryption and penetration testing.  

---

## 5.4 Governance & Monitoring
- Weekly steering committee reviews (IT, Compliance, Business).  
- Monthly reporting to leadership on KPIs (dropouts, fraud cases prevented).  
- Continuous model monitoring to detect AI bias and ensure fairness.

This **implementation strategy** ensures a balance of **speed, compliance, and scalability**, aligned with industry best practices (Genpact, Deloitte).

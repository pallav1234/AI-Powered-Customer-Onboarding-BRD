- Integrate with Aadhaar e-KYC, PAN, and CKYC APIs.  
- Train staff on new compliance dashboards.  

**Phase 3: Enterprise Deployment (12 months)**
- Expand across India, covering both mass-market and premium customers.  
- Launch multilingual app experience.  
- Integrate advanced fraud detection and predictive dropout models.  

**Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)**
- Continuous model retraining with new datasets.  
- AI-driven analytics to further personalize onboarding.  
- Feedback loop with compliance teams for rule engine updates.
